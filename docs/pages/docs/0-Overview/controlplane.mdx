## About

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--8">
    <p>
      As part of the Open Telekom Integration Platform, the Control Plane is the central management layer that governs the operation of your Kubernetes cluster. It maintains the desired state of the system, manages workloads, and provides interfaces for user interaction and automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Control Plane follows a modular architecture with specialized components that work together to provide a complete platform for API management and workload orchestration. It extends the native Kubernetes capabilities through custom controllers and operators that implement domain-specific logic.
    </p>

## Components

<InfoSection type="tip" title="Platform composition">
  The Control Plane consists of multiple specialized components that work together to provide a complete platform for API management and workload orchestration.
</InfoSection>

### Resource Hierarchy

<InfoSection type="note" title="Resource model">
  The Control Plane uses a hierarchical resource model with three main resource types that interact with each other. This model provides clear separation of concerns while enabling powerful resource relationships.
</InfoSection>

    subgraph "Admin Resources"
        Environment[Environment] --> Zone[Zone]
        Zone --> RemoteOrg[Remote Organization]
    end
    
    subgraph "Organization Resources"
        Group[Group] --> Team[Team]

        Api --> ApiSubscription[API Subscription]
    end
    
    %% Relationships between resources

    Team -. "owns" .-> Rover

    %% Apply styles
    class Environment,Zone,RemoteOrg admin
    class Group,Team org
    class Application,Rover,ApiSpec,Api,ApiExposure,ApiSubscription workload
```

1. **Admin Resources**: Platform-level resources managed by administrators
   - Environments: Logical groupings of zones and clusters
   - Zones: Represent deployment targets with specific capabilities
   - RemoteOrganizations: References to organizations in remote clusters

2. **Organization Resources**: Team and project management resources
   - Groups: Logical groupings of teams
   - Teams: Represent development or operational teams with members

3. **Workload Resources**: Application and API resources
   - Rovers: Deployable units that can be scheduled on clusters
   - Applications: Collections of related services
   - APIs: Service interfaces with specifications

### Operators

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--8">
    <p>
      In addition to the core components, the control plane may also run custom operators. These are specialized control loops designed to manage complex domain-specific applications and configurations. These operators extend Kubernetes functionality using the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">Operator pattern</a>, combining custom resource definitions (CRDs) with controllers that automate lifecycle management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each operator encapsulates a distinct domain of responsibility, operating independently with minimal interdependencies, which promotes modularity, simplifies maintenance, and enhances the scalability of the overall control plane architecture.
    </p>

These operators work alongside the Kubernetes API server and etcd, watching for changes to custom resources and ensuring the actual state of their managed components aligns with the desired configuration.

### API Servers

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--7">
    <p>
      API Servers are RESTful APIs for managing Kubernetes custom resources. They provide standardized HTTP-based interfaces to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) custom-defined objects within the Kubernetes cluster. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These custom resources are typically defined using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and extend the Kubernetes API with domain-specific objects (e.g., Application, Gateway, Organization). The API follows REST principles and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. It supports authentication and authorization, enabling automation and integration with UIs and external systems.
